- fix build error ins userspace_examples

2017-11-19
- fix build errors (asm/uaccess.h -> linux/uaccess.h)

2017-04-25
- add skeleton for gpio and irq based lcd hd44780 driver

2017-04-24
- next steps for i2c_gpio_driver_simple and co

2017-04-09
- add userspace example for accessing a lcd1602 display


2017-03-15
- start implementing i2c-gpio driver (simple)


2017-03-02
- add some actual pics
- continue pcf8574 userspace implementation (cyclon example with 8 leds)


2016-09-20
- remove hdd44780 userspace example


2016-09-14
- some smaller cleanups


2016-06-13
- add some doc about udev rules and kernel driver


2016-05-18
- gpio_driver is aware of instance specific pin config


2016-05-15
- simple userpace examples for gpio (swt and led)
- first schematic of gpio hardware


2016-05-xx
- working char_driver with open/close/read/write/ioctl
- working usage example of char_driver
- add skeletons for the other driver examples


2016-04-29
- removed "old school" char_driver -> makes no sense
- remove i2c driver skeleton
- rename gpio_driver to i2c_gpio_driver
- rename udev rules to 60-* instead of 90_* (the higher the number the higher
  is the priority of the rule -> 60 fits bettern than 90 ... but only a
  question of personal taste)
- add udev rule for i2c_gpio_driver


2016-04-28
- add some documentation with links below ./Documentation
- add skeleton for a gpio based irq line (for bananapi and olimex-a20)
- add userspace example for the char example driver (./char_driver)
- add udev rule for char_driver (./udev)


2016-04-27
- add some first skeleton for gpio driver based on a pcf8574


2016-xx-xx
- retructure repository to support more than on template
  The idea is to have
  -> a template for a char driver
  -> a template for a I2C driver
  -> a template for a GPIO driver
  -> a template for a SPI driver
  as the basic for concrete projects like
  -> https://github.com/tjohann/lcd160x_driver.git
  -> https://github.com/tjohann/pcf8574_gpio.git
