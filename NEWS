- add some doc about udev rules and kernel driver

2016-05-18
- gpio_driver is aware of instance specific pin config


2016-05-15
- simple userpace examples for gpio (swt and led)
- first schematic of gpio hardware


2016-05-xx
- working char_driver with open/close/read/write/ioctl
- working usage example of char_driver
- add skeletons for the other driver examples


2016-04-29
- removed "old school" char_driver -> makes no sense
- remove i2c driver skeleton
- rename gpio_driver to i2c_gpio_driver
- rename udev rules to 60-* instead of 90_* (the higher the number the higher
  is the priority of the rule -> 60 fits bettern than 90 ... but only a
  question of personal taste)
- add udev rule for i2c_gpio_driver


2016-04-28
- add some documentation with links below ./Documentation
- add skeleton for a gpio based irq line (for bananapi and olimex-a20)
- add userspace example for the char example driver (./char_driver)
- add udev rule for char_driver (./udev)


2016-04-27
- add some first skeleton for gpio driver based on a pcf8574


2016-xx-xx
- retructure repository to support more than on template
  The idea is to have
  -> a template for a char driver
  -> a template for a I2C driver
  -> a template for a GPIO driver
  -> a template for a SPI driver
  as the basic for concrete projects like
  -> https://github.com/tjohann/lcd160x_driver.git
  -> https://github.com/tjohann/pcf8574_gpio.git
  -> https://github.com/tjohann/max7119_array.git
