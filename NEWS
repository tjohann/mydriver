- retructure repository to support more than on template
  The idea is to have 
  -> a template for a char driver                            
  -> a template for a I2C driver
  -> a template for a GPIO driver
  -> a template for a SPI driver
  as the basic for concrete projects like
  -> https://github.com/tjohann/lcd160x_driver.git
  -> https://github.com/tjohann/pcf8574_gpio.git
  -> https://github.com/tjohann/max7119_array.git
